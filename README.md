# Housing Price Analysis
### Coursework: Data Mining using R: The course covered applied part of r used to do data analysis using data mining techniques.

#### Objective: 
To understand correlation of different independent with house prices, impute missing values and remove data inconsistencies to predict housing prices with best accuracy.

#### Data Source:
The data relating to housing prices recorded with 80 independent variables was obtained from Kaggle (“Predicting Housing Prices | Kaggle”), an extensive data resource reputed especially for its analytics competitions.

#### Approach: 
The study of housing prices starts with an exploratory analysis using tableau, which uses visual methods such as box plots, histograms and scatter plots to provide a snapshot of the relationships between various groups of independent and dependent variables. Post the exploratory analysis, analytical techniques such as regression analysis, regularization and XGBoost ensembling are used to predict housing prices for test dataset.
